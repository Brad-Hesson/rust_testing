This is a repository for my first time trying out Rust.  I have implemented a couple different data structures for practice while I learn the language.

## This library includes:
- A simple threadpool implementation
- A pure linked list implementation
- A pure deque implementation with !unsafe! code
- A pure rope implementation for strings
